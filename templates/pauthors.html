			<h4 class="subt">Who were the Puritans?</h4>
			<p class="para">
				The Puritans were a religous group that was formed in England under the Protestant reformation, which sought religious freedom from the Catholic Church. So, they set sail West from England towards North America. They first arrived in modern day Masssachussets around 1620. Being that they were the first settlers in North America, their literature is some of the earliest American literature known.

			<h4 class="subt">What do we known about their literature?</h4>
			<p class="para">
				Puritan literature can best be described as pursuasive. They strayed away from using literature as a form of media or entertainment like we do today. Instead they used their literature for specific purposes such as spreading the word of God. There is a strong emphasis on their religion with references to the Bible and God. One genre of Puritan literature that we have studdied were the accounts of Puritan women who were taken capitve by the Native Americans in the area. These captivity narratives may have been the true accounts of the women's capptivity, but they are written by a male figure of authority, commonly a preacher. The Puritans used these works as a form of propoganda for more people in England to come to America, to send supplies and aid, as well as to spread their Puritan ideaology.

			<h4 class="subt">Mary Rowlandson</h4>
			<p class="para">
				Mary Rowlandson was born in England in 1637 and set sail with her parents for North America in 1637. They left England as part of a migration of Puritan people to an area called Dawnland, around Massachussets Bay. Over her time growing up in the settlement, more and more Puritans began to migrate to the area which caused tensions with the nearby native tribes, to increase. In February 1676 an alliance of the nieghboring native tribes that consisted of the Nipmuc, Narragansett, and Wampanoag attack the settlement and took 24 settlers into capitvity, including Rowlandson and her children. Her narrative of her captivity, published in America under the title <i>The Sovereignty and Goodness of God</i> was so much of a success, it was sent to England to be published. For the England editions however, the title was drastically different and was changed to: <i>A True History of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson, A Minister's Wide in New-England. Wherein Is Set forth, The Cruel and Inhumane Usage She Underwent amongst the Heathens, for Eleven Weeks Time: And Her Deliverence from Them</i>. With our knowledge of Puritan beleifs and their idea of literature, it is clear as to why the original title was purely about God. It was used to put God and the Puritan ideas at the forefront. The one for the English market took a different approach, to spread propoganda and racism directed toward the Native American tribes in New-England.
