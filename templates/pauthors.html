				<li class="subt"> Who were the Puritans?</li>
				<p class="para">
					The Puritans were a religious group that was formed in England under the Protestant reformation, which sought religious freedom from the Catholic Church. So, they set sail West from England towards North America. They first arrived in modern day Massachusetts around 1620. Being that they were the first settlers in North America, their literature is some of the earliest American literature known.

				<li class="subt">What Do We Known About Their literature?</li>
				<p class="para">
					&emsp; Puritan literature can best be described as persuasive. They strayed away from using literature as a form of media or entertainment like we do today. Instead they used their literature for specific purposes such as spreading the word of God. There is a strong emphasis on their religion with references to the Bible and God. The center piece of Puritan literature that we have studied were the accounts of Puritan women who were taken captive by the Native Americans in the area. These captivity narratives may have been the true accounts of the women's captivity, but they are written by a male figure of authority, commonly a preacher. The Puritans used these works as a form of propaganda for more people in England to come to America, to send supplies and aid, as well as to spread their Puritan ideology.

				<li class="subt">Mary Rowlandson</li>
				<p class="para">
					&emsp;Mary Rowlandson was born in England in 1637 and set sail with her parents for North America in 1637. They left England as part of a migration of Puritan people to an area called Dawnland, around Massachussets Bay. Over her time growing up in the settlement, more and more Puritans began to migrate to the area which caused tensions with the nearby native tribes, to increase. In February 1676 an alliance of the nieghboring native tribes that consisted of the Nipmuc, Narragansett, and Wampanoag attack the settlement and took 24 settlers into capitvity, including Rowlandson and her children.
					<br>&emsp;Once she was returned, she wrote a narrative of her captivity under the supervision of "Increase Mather (1639-1723), the influential Puritan minsiter who was partially responsible for the publication of Rowlandson's narrative" (Rowlandson 285) that would later be known as the capstone of her literary career and is studied by scholars to this day. The narrative of her captivity, published in America under the title <i>The Sovereignty and Goodness of God</i> was so much of a success, it was sent to England to be published. For the England editions however, the title was drastically different and was changed to: <i>A True History of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson, A Minister's Wife in New-England. Wherein Is Set forth, The Cruel and Inhumane Usage She Underwent amongst the Heathens, for Eleven Weeks Time: And Her Deliverence from Them</i>. 
					<br>&emsp;With our knowledge of Puritan beleifs and their idea of literature, it is clear as to why the original title was purely about God. It was used to put God and the Puritan ideas at the forefront. In the preface written by Increase Mather, he references 9 Bible verses, most of them being from the book of Psalms. In Christianity Psalms is a collaborative book of poems, often used to provide guidance and to reaffirm faith. These verses are mostly referenced to give the Puritans God's reasoning for death and suffering around them during the Native American's attack. This is there subsitute for mourning, as it is considered a sin to mourn according to the Puritans. Mather goes as far as to say that he and the other Puritans have "reselmblance to those of Joseph, David, and Daniel" (Rowlandson 287), all biblical figures saved by divine intervention as he has faith that they will be saved by God. Rowlandson herself quotes the Bible and talks about God to reaffirm her faith and comfort her during her captivity.
					<br>&emsp;The title for the English market took a different approach, to spread propoganda and racism directed toward the Native American tribes in New-England. Most of this comes from the "influential minister" Increase Mather in his preface. Native Americans are reffered to as "cruel and barbaric savages" (Rowlandson 286) and are demonized for their attack on Lancaster. The irony of this is that the minister aknowledges that the Puritan's invaded the Narragansett and "were now driven quite far from their own country" (Rowlandson 286). It seems that Mather is justifying them taking the Narragansett's land because they were "savages". The racism directed towards the Native Americans and the extensive referrences to the Bible and Puritan beliefs serves as the <b>true</b> narrative of Mary Rowlandson that the minister Increase Mather used for Puritan propoganda.
