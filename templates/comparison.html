			<h1 class="title">How do a Puritan and a Former Slave relate?</h1>
			<p class="para">
				&emsp; Although Mary Rowlandson and Phillis Wheatley lived nearly 200 years apart, they share many strategies and themes in their writing that they used to persuade readers in the form of a narrative. From the Puritan side with Mary Rowlandson, they used their narrative to spread Puritan ideas. After leaving England in search of religious freedom, they want others to join them and the best way to do that is for them to start practicing Puritan beliefs. They also used this as a way to justify the stealing of land from the nearby Native American tribes. With African slaves, Phillis Wheatley become an icon for the antislavery movement because of her poems. The poems she wrote and that were published in England caused her to be emancipated, and because the poems were so popular, thousands of people read about the horrors of slavery and heard Wheatley's call for action. Both of these authors were very religious, quoting Bible verses, referencing biblical characters, and preaching in their works. A subtle detail yet large factor in the success and impact of both of their works is that they were both women. This was done more intentionally by the Puritans, but it plays into the "damsel in distress" idea. Even looking at modern American literature and media as a whole we can see some of these themes still being used today. A prime example is in old American Western films, where films are constructed in the form of a narrative that include the justification of violence against Native Americans, a strong emphasis on faith, and use of female characters for emotional appeal. Maybe these themes are not intended to conform to the themes and style of early American literature, but the connection is there.
