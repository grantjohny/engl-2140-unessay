					&emsp; Slavery, the sin of early colonists and the South, was a large scale system that revolved around the purchasing, trading, selling, and abuse of African Americans in the name of profit for plantation owners. Africans were sold to Europeans on the West coast of Africa with the intent of using them to fuel the economy of the 13 colonies and later, the United States. Until the passing of the 13th amendment to the Constitution in 1865 after the American Civil War, millions of African Americans were kept against their will to farm crops, and faced punishment and death if they disobeyed or attempted to flee their captors.

					&emsp; Because they were taken away from their homes and brought to a entire different continent, African slaves could only communicate with one another, having unlikely knowing very much of the English language. This means that they were not able to read or write anything either, unless they learned to. Many slaves, often women, were given lessons to read and write commonly by children on the plantation or through lessons from the wives of plantation owners. This would prove to be a crucial factor to the abolitionist movement that sought to end slavery. Slaves that were able to read and write could send letters to anti-slavery activists in hopes of them assisting in their escape from plantations. Slave owners saw this is as a threat and would punish slaves that were caught reading or writing.

					&emsp; Phillis Wheatley was an African American poet during the late 18th century and was "the first author of African descent to publish a book of poetry in English" (Wheatley 718). She was taken from Africa by slave traders when she was about 7 years old and was sold to the Wheatley family in Boston, Massachusetts. There she was taught to read and write, and even they even encouraged her to write poetry. Not only could she read and write, which was rare for slaves, but she was well educated as we can see in her work where she references Greek mythology. Her poetry is well known for uncovering the crimes of slavery to the world and she is seen as "an icon of the American antislavery movement" (Wheatley 719). She was a religous woman, and it shows in her work as she makes several references to the Bible and calling on God. She preaches through her work saying "Remember, Christians, Negros, black as Cain, May be refined and join th' angelic train" (Wheatley 721), saying that all people regardless of the color of their skin can go to heaven.
					<br>&emsp; She is best known for her poem <i>On Being Brought from Africa to America</i>, that gives an insight into the treatment of slaves at the height of the Atlantic Slave Trade that brought millions of Africans to North America and other parts of the world. Before the poem there is a short letter to King George of England. In the poem she expressed her support of the king and praises him saying "May George, belov'd by all the nations around" (Wheatley 721). I see this as Wheatley "sucking up" to the king in order to capture his attention because at the end of the letter she says, "A monarch's smile can set his subjects free" (Wheatley 721). Knowing Wheatley and the context of the poem, we can assume that she is referring to the freedom of African slaves and end to the slave trade. 
					<br>&emsp; This was not the last time that Wheatley would look across the Atlantic towards England for help in spreading the horror stories of slavery in hopes to end the slave trade. Late in her career, she traveled with her enslavers son to England where she looked to find a publisher for her work, as trying to publish in the colonies would be very difficult considering the perception of Africans in North America. It was then in London where she published her "Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral" that gave her fame and a platform to speak on. After the success of her poetry in London, readers "expressed outrage that such an accomplished poet was still enslaved" (Wheatley 719). She was then emancipated by her enslaver. The publication in London inadvertently turned her literary, poetic masterpieces into propaganda that was used to secure her own freedom, and spark for the antislavery movement.
